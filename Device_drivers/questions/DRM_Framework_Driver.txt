01. DRM and KMS - Definition
>A>
    - DRM stands for Direct Rendering Manager and was introduced to deal with graphic cards embedding GPUs
    - KMS stands for Kernel Mode Setting and is a sub-part of the DRM API
    - KMS provide a way to configure the display pipeline of a graphic card (or an embedded system)
02. DRM/KMS Framework introduction, uses, & offerings
>A>
    - The DRM/KMS framework is dedicated to the management of the display, graphic and composition subsystems.
    - With the help of other Linux multimedia frameworks and applications, the DRM/KMS framework is typically used:
	1. to compose animated contents taking advantages of the hardware acceleration.
	2. to control both display interfaces and external displays including their settings (resolution, frequency, multi-screen...).
	3. to display this animated contents on display panels or HDMI outputs.
    - The DRM/KMS framework offers:
	1. A kernel level interface driver for display, graphic and composition internal and external hardware peripherals.
	2. A userland level interface, with the help of libdrm/libkms libraries, to get access to the related hardware
	  features, configuration and hardware acceleration.
03. How to display things in the Linux world ?
>A>
    1. FBDEV: Framebuffer Device
    2. DRM/KMS: Direct Rendering Manager / Kernel Mode Setting
    3. V4L2: Video for Linux 2
04. How to choose one from above:
>A>
    - Each subsytsem provides its own set of features
    - Different levels of complexity
    - Different levels of activity
05. Why to choose DRM/KMS over other two ?
>A>
    - Actively maintained
    - Provides fine grained control on the display pipeline
    - Widely used by user-space graphic stacks
    - Provides a full set of advanced features
06. Why not FBDEV ?
>A>
    - Less actively maintained
    - Does not provides all the features we needed (overlays, hwcursor, ...)
    - Developers are now encouraged to move to DRM/KMS
07. Why not V4L2 ?
    >A> Well suited for video capture and specific video output devices but not for ”complex” display controllers
08. GPU vs. Graphics Card: What’s the Difference?
    >A>
    - While the terms GPU and graphics card (or video card) are often used interchangeably, there is a subtle
      distinction between these terms. Much like a motherboard contains a CPU, a graphics card refers to an add-in board
      that incorporates the GPU. This board also includes the raft of components required to both allow the GPU to
      function and connect to the rest of the system.
    - GPUs come in two basic types: integrated and discrete. An integrated GPU does not come on its own separate card
      at all and is instead embedded alongside the CPU. A discrete GPU is a distinct chip that is mounted on its own
      circuit board and is typically attached to a PCI Express slot.
09. What is Framebuffer ?
10. GEM and TTM - Memory Manager
    >A>
    - TTM stands for Translation Table Manager and is a generic memory-manager provided by the kernel.
      It does not provide a common user-space API so you need to look at each driver interface if you want to use it.
    - GEM stands for Graphics Execution Manager and is a generic DRM memory-management framework in the kernel,
      that is used by many different drivers. Gem is designed to manage graphics memory, control access to the graphics
      device execution context and handle essentially NUMA environment unique to modern graphics hardware. Gem allows multiple
      applications to share graphics device resources without the need to constantly reload the entire graphics card.
      Data may be shared between multiple applications with gem ensuring that the correct memory synchronization occurs.
11. What is FourCC (Four character code) ?
    >A>
    - It is a 4-byte identifier which specifies the format of a video stream
    - Every codec has its own unique FourCC. Commonly, each byte corresponds to a printable character in the ASCII
      character set, making the sequence human-readable.
    - describes the memory buffer organization
12. What is CRTC (CRT controller) ?
    >A>
    - Configure the appropriate display settings:
        Display timings
        Display resolution
    - Scan out frame buffer content to one or more displays
    - Update the frame buffer
    - Implemented through struct drm_crtc funcs and struct drm_crtc_helper funcs
13. What is Hardware acceleration? definition
    >A>
    - Hardware acceleration refers to the use of specialized hardware components or techniques to
      perform specific tasks or functions more efficiently than general-purpose software running on
      a CPU (Central Processing Unit).
    - It involves offloading computationally intensive or repetitive tasks to dedicated hardware
      units designed to handle those tasks efficiently, resulting in improved performance and
      reduced workload on the CPU.
    - This can include things like rendering graphics, processing audio or video, compressing data,
      encrypting or decrypting information, and running artificial intelligence algorithms.
14. Architecture of DRM KMS
    TODO: //Add diagram of DRM KMS 
15. DRM/KMS Components(1/6): Framebuffer
    >A>
    - This is a standard object storing information about the content to be displayed
    - Information stored
	- References to memory regions used to store display content
	- Format of the frames stored in memory
	- Active area within the memory region (content that will displayed)
    - DRM Framebuﬀer is a virtual object (relies on a speciﬁc implementation)
    - Framebuﬀer implementation depends on:
	- The memory manager in use (GEM or TTM)
	- The display controller capabilities:
	    - Supported DMA transfer types (Contiguous Memory or Scatter Gather)
	    - IOMMU ( Inout Output Memory Management Unit)
    - Default implementation available for GEM objects using CMA (Contiguous Memory Allocator):
	drivers/gpu/drm/drm_fb_cma_helper.c
    - Other implementations usually depend on the Display Controller:
	Scatter Gather example: drivers/gpu/drm/tegra/
	IOMMU example: drivers/gpu/drm/exynos/

    - Conﬁgure the appropriate display settings:
	- Display timings
	- Display resolution
    - Scan out frame buﬀer content to one or more displays
    - Update the frame buﬀer
    - Implemented through struct drm_crtc_funcs and struct drm_crtc_helper_funcs
17. DRM/KMS Components(3/6): Plane
    >A>
    - A plane is an image layer (Be careful: not related to the planes referenced by a framebuﬀer).
      It refers to a display hardware component that is responsible for composing and displaying a
      specific image or video source on a screen.
    - In modern graphics architectures, displays are typically composed of multiple layers or
      planes. Each plane can represent a separate image or video source, such as a framebuffer or a
      video overlay, and has its own properties, such as position, size, and format.
    - The DRM KMS subsystem provides an interface for managing these planes. The planes are
      associated with the CRTC (Cathode Ray Tube Controller), which represents the display
      controller hardware. The CRTC controls the scanout process, determining how the pixel data
      from the planes is mapped to the display output.
    - The final image displayed by the CRTC is the composition of one or several planes.
    - Planes in DRM KMS have various properties that can be configured, including the framebuffer
      source, position on the screen, pixel format, scaling, blending, and other attributes. By
      manipulating these properties, developers can control how different layers of content are
      combined and displayed on the screen.
    - Plane support implemented through struct drm_plane_funcs
18. Different types of Planes in the context of DRM KMS:
    >A>
    1. DRM_PLANE_TYPE_PRIMARY (mandatory, 1 per CRTC)
       - Used by the CRTC to store its frame buﬀer
       - Typically used to display a background image or graphics content
    2. DRM_PLANE_TYPE_CURSOR (optional, 1 per CRTC)
       - Used to display a cursor (like a mouse cursor)
    3. DRM_PLANE_TYPE_OVERLAY (optional, 0 to N per CRTC)
	- Used to beneﬁt from hardware composition
	- Typically used to display windows with dynamic content (like a video)
	- In case of multiple CRTCs in the display controller, the overlay planes
	  can often be dynamically attached to a speciﬁc CRTC when required
19. DRM Major number in Linux is 226.
20. struct drm_crtc_funcs
    >A> To control CRTCs for a given device

    The drm_crtc_funcs structure is the central CRTC management structure in the DRM.
    Each CRTC controls one or more connectors (note that the name CRTC is simply historical,
    a CRTC may control LVDS, VGA, DVI, TV out, etc. connectors, not just CRTs).

    These functions provide the necessary functionality and operations for managing and controlling
    the CRTC, including configuration, page flipping, gamma correction, properties, cursor handling,
    CRC calculation, and atomic modesetting support.

    Few important functions available in struct drm_crtc_funcs
    .set_config - Sets the configuration for the CRTC.
		  Update the frame buffer being scanned out.
                  Configure the display mode: timings, resolution,

    .enable_vblank: Enables vertical blanking interrupts for the CRTC, allowing synchronization with the display's vertical refresh.
    .disable_vblank: Disables vertical blanking interrupts for the CRTC, stopping synchronization with the display's vertical refresh.

21. struct drm_crtc_helper_funcs
    >A> helper operations for CRTCs

    These hooks are used by the legacy CRTC helpers, the transitional plane helpers and the new
    atomic modesetting helpers. These functions provide various essential operations and
    functionalities for managing and controlling the CRTC. They handle tasks such as fixing up mode
    parameters, setting display modes, preparing and committing mode settings, handling framebuffer
    base address changes, managing DPMS state changes, and performing cleanup operations for the
    CRTC helper

    Few important functions available in struct drm_crtc_funcs
    .mode_set_nofb - Sets the display mode for the CRTC without changing the framebuffer.
    .atomic_disable - Disables the CRTC output.
    .atomic_enable - Enables the CRTC output.
    .atomic_check - Drivers should check plane-update related CRTC constraints in this hook.
    .atomic_begin - Drivers should prepare for an atomic update of multiple planes on a CRTC in this hook.

22. What is gamma correction ?
    >A>
    - Gamma correction, in the context of DRM KMS (Direct Rendering Manager Kernel Mode Setting),
      refers to the adjustment of the brightness and contrast of a display to achieve more accurate
      and consistent color reproduction.
    - The gamma correction process involves manipulating the relationship between the input signal
      and the corresponding output luminance of the display
    - Gamma correction is typically performed using lookup tables (LUTs) that map input color values
      to output color values. By adjusting the gamma values in the LUT, the display can compensate
      for the non-linear gamma response curve and produce more accurate color reproduction.
    - In the DRM KMS subsystem, the struct drm_crtc_funcs includes the .gamma_set function, which
      allows setting the gamma correction values for a CRTC (Cathode Ray Tube Controller). This
      function provides the interface to adjust the gamma correction parameters, enabling
      fine-tuning of the display's brightness and contrast characteristics to achieve more accurate
      color representation.
23. struct drm_plane_funcs
    >A>
    - It represents a set of function pointers that define the operations and behavior of a DRM
      plane. The functions defined within this structure are essential for managing and manipulating planes.

             for turning the display on/off or setting power-saving modes.
26. Use of component_add() in device driver
    >A>
    - Used to register a component with the Linux kernel's Component Framework
    - The Component Framework in Linux provides a mechanism for managing and interacting with
      loadable kernel modules (LKMs) that encapsulate specific functionalities or features. It
      allows drivers and other kernel components to declare their dependencies on other components
      and ensures proper initialization and interaction between them.
    - The component_add function is used by a driver to register itself as a component with the
      Component Framework. By doing so, the driver specifies its dependencies and enables the
      framework to handle the initialization, ordering, and interaction of components at runtime
    - Read more @ https://docs.kernel.org/driver-api/component.html
27. struct drm_connector_helper_funcs
    >A>
    - Assist in various aspects of connector handling and behavior
    - Are used by the atomic and legacy modeset helpers and by the probe helpers
    - Few important functions are:
      .get_modes: Retrieves the supported display modes for the connector. It populates the list of
	    available modes that the display can support.
      .best_encoder: Determines the best encoder to be used for the connector. It helps in selecting
	    the most suitable encoder based on the available options and requirements.
      .mode_valid: Checks if a given display mode is valid and supported by the connector. This
	    function validates whether the requested mode can be set on the display.
28. DRM KMS Component(5/6): Encoder
    >A>
    - Directly related to the Connector concept
    - Responsible for converting a frame into the appropriate format to be transmitted through the connector
    - Example: HDMI connector is transmiting TMDS encoded data, and thus needs a TMDS encoder
    - Implemented through struct drm_encoder_funcs and struct drm_encoder_helper_funcs
    - Few important functions of struct drm_encoder_funcs:
      .destroy: Cleans up resources and performs necessary operations when the encoder is being destroyed.
    - Few important functions of struct drm_encoder_helper_funcs:
      .enable: Enables the encoder, allowing it to start sending data to the connected display.
      .disable: Disables the encoder, stopping the data transmission to the connected display.
      .atomic_mode_set: Sets the display mode for the encoder during atomic commit.

    - Device exposed to userspace (handles all user-space requests)
    - Implemented through struct drm_driver
    - Call drm_dev_alloc() then drm_dev_register() to register a DRM device
    - driver_features should contain DRIVER_MODESET, DRIVER_ATOMIC, DRIVER_GEM or both depending on the DRM device features
30. "Bridge" - In the context of DRM KMS
    >A>
    - In the context of DRM (Direct Rendering Manager) KMS (Kernel Modesetting), a bridge refers to
      a hardware component or module that acts as an intermediary between a graphics controller
      (GPU) and a display device. It is responsible for converting the display data from the GPU
      into a format compatible with the specific display device.
    - Bridges are commonly used in scenarios where the display device and the GPU have different
      signaling or data formats. They facilitate the connection and communication between the GPU
      and the display device by performing necessary conversions, protocol translations, and signal
      adaptations.
    - Some common types of bridges used in DRM KMS include:
      1. DisplayPort (DP) Bridges: These bridges enable connectivity between a GPU with a
         DisplayPort output and display devices with different interfaces, such as HDMI or VGA. They
         handle the necessary protocol conversions and signal adaptations to ensure compatibility.
      2. HDMI Bridges: HDMI bridges are used when there is a need to connect a GPU with an HDMI
         output to display devices with different interfaces, such as DisplayPort or DVI. These bridges
         handle the conversion and adaptation of HDMI signals to the target interface.
      3. DVI Bridges: DVI bridges serve a similar purpose as HDMI bridges, allowing the connection
         between a GPU with a DVI output and display devices with different interfaces.
    - The presence of bridges in DRM KMS enables the utilization of a wide range of display devices
      with different interfaces and signal requirements. They provide the necessary hardware-level
      conversions to ensure compatibility and enable seamless communication between the GPU and the
      display device.
31. "Encoder Slave" - In the context of DRM KMS
    >A>
    - In the context of DRM (Direct Rendering Manager) KMS (Kernel Modesetting), an encoder slave
      refers to an auxiliary encoder that operates in conjunction with a primary encoder. The
      primary encoder is responsible for generating the display data, while the encoder slave
      assists in transmitting or encoding the data to a specific output or display device.
    - The concept of an encoder slave is primarily used in scenarios where a single GPU (Graphics
      Processing Unit) has multiple display outputs, each requiring its own dedicated encoder. The primary
      encoder handles the primary display output, while the encoder slave(s) handle additional display
      outputs.
    - The encoder slave operates under the control of the primary encoder and is typically associated with
      a specific output interface, such as HDMI, DisplayPort, or DVI. It performs the necessary signal
      encoding and formatting tasks specific to that output interface.
    - The primary encoder coordinates the overall operation and configuration of both the primary display
      output and the encoder slave(s). It determines the display data to be sent to each encoder, manages
      their synchronization, and ensures proper functioning of the multiple display outputs.
    - By utilizing encoder slaves, DRM KMS enables the support of multiple display outputs from a single
      GPU, allowing for multi-monitor configurations or driving multiple display devices simultaneously.
      This capability is crucial in modern computing systems where the demand for multiple displays is
      common, such as in desktop workstations or multi-screen setups
32. "DPMS" - In the context of DRM KMS
    >A>
    - DPMS stands for Display Power Management Signaling. It refers to a feature that allows control over
      the power state of a display or monitor connected to a graphics device.
    - DPMS provides mechanisms to control the display's power modes, including turning the display on or
      off, and activating power-saving modes such as standby, suspend, or power-off. By controlling the
      power state of the display, DPMS helps conserve energy, extend the display's lifespan, and manage
      power consumption in the system.
    - In DRM KMS, the DPMS feature is typically handled through the dpms function pointer within the
      struct drm_connector_helper_funcs structure. This function is responsible for controlling the power
      state of the display associated with the DRM connector.
    - When the DPMS state is changed, the dpms function is called, allowing the driver to perform the
      necessary operations to control the power state of the display. For example, when DPMS is set to
      "off," the driver may turn off the display's backlight or put it into a low-power mode. When DPMS is
      set to "on," the driver may turn on the display and restore it to its previous state.
    - The DPMS feature is typically used to implement power-saving functionality in desktop environments
      or to respond to user-defined power management settings. It enables the operating system or the user
      to control the display's power state based on inactivity or specific power management policies.
    - Overall, DPMS in DRM KMS provides a standardized mechanism for controlling the power state of
      displays connected to a graphics device, allowing for power conservation and efficient
      management of display resources.
33. "EDID(Extended Display Identification Data)" - In the context of DRM KMS
    >A>
    - EDID in DRM KMS refers to the standardized data format that provides detailed information about a
      display device. It is used by the graphics driver to identify and configure the display device
      properly, ensuring optimal display settings and plug-and-play functionality.
    - EDID is stored in a small EEPROM chip embedded in the display device. It contains vital
      information such as the display's supported resolutions, refresh rates, color capabilities,
      aspect ratios, and audio capabilities. Additionally, it may provide information about the
      display's manufacturer, model, serial number, and supported display timings.
    - The graphics driver, using the DRM KMS subsystem, retrieves the EDID data from the display
      device during the initialization process. The EDID information allows the driver to accurately
      identify and configure the display device according to its capabilities.
    - The DRM KMS subsystem uses the EDID data to determine the best display mode and timing that is
      compatible with both the display device and the graphics driver. It ensures that the display
      device is driven at its optimal settings, including the correct resolution, refresh rate, and
      color depth.
    - The EDID data is crucial in enabling plug-and-play functionality, as it provides the necessary
      information for the graphics driver to automatically detect and configure the display device
      without manual intervention. It allows the system to adapt to different display devices and
      ensures optimal compatibility between the graphics driver and the display
34. Page flipping
    >A>
    - Page flipping is a technique that uses multiple buffers in the framebuffer to achieve smooth
      and tear-free updates on a display. It involves swapping the front and back buffers during the
      display's vertical blanking interval to ensure seamless rendering without visible artifacts.
    - The page flipping process involves rendering graphics or updating the image in a hidden back
      buffer. Once the updates are complete, a page flip operation is performed, synchronizing it
      with the display's vertical blanking interval. This swaps the front buffer with the updated
      back buffer, displaying the new image without tearing or visual artifacts.
35. Page flipping process with example
    >A> Here's a simplified example illustrating the page flipping process:
    1. Initially, we have a front buffer (Buffer A) and a back buffer (Buffer B). Buffer A is
       currently being displayed on the screen, while Buffer B is hidden.
    2. The rendering process performs graphics operations and updates the image in Buffer B.
    3. Once the rendering operations in Buffer B are completed, a page flip request is made to the
       graphics driver or the DRM subsystem.
    4. The page flip operation is synchronized with the display's vertical blanking interval. During
       this period, the screen is not actively refreshing.
    5. When the vertical blanking interval occurs, the front and back buffers are swapped. Buffer B
       becomes the new front buffer and Buffer A becomes the new back buffer.
    6. The updated image in Buffer B is now displayed on the screen, providing a smooth transition
       without any visible tearing.
    7. The rendering process can continue its operations on the new back buffer (Buffer A) without
       affecting the image displayed on the screen.
    8. The process repeats, with the rendering operations being performed on the back buffer and the
       page flip operation swapping the buffers during subsequent vertical blanking intervals.
