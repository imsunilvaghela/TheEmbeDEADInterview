1. Give me one line definition of Device tree. What was the actual need for it ?
   >A>
   - A DeviceTree(DT) , is a data structure and language for describing hardware.
   - More specifically, it is a description of hardware that is readable by an operating system so that the operating system doesn’t need to hard code details of the machine.
   - The primary purpose of Device Tree in Linux is to provide a way to describe non-discoverable hardware. This information was previously(before kernel v2.6) hard-coded in source code
2. What are the major reasons linux uses device-tree ?
   >A>
   1. platform identification,
   2. runtime configuration, and
   3. device population.
3. What are .dts, .dtb and .dtsi files  ?
   >A>
   .dtb : For compiled device-tree.
   .dts : Files for board-level definitions
   .dtsi : Files for included files, generally containing SoC-level definitions
4. Can we split device tree files in several files ? How ?
   >A> Yes, Using .dtsi files.
5. What is Flattened Device Tree (FDT) and Expanded Device Tree (EDT) ?
   >A>
   - The device tree source is compiled into a binary format contained in a .dtb blob file. The format of the data in the .dtb blob file is commonly referred to as a Flattened Device Tree.
   - The Linux operating system uses the device tree data to find and register the devices in the system.
   - The FDT is accessed in the raw form during the very early phases of boot, but is expanded into a kernel internal data structure known as the Expanded Device Tree (EDT) for more efficient access for later phases of the boot and after the system has completed booting.
6. How to generate device tree binary file using device tree source file ? And vice-versa ?
   >A>
   Using dtc - device tree compiler
   dtc -I dtb -O dts -o system.dts system.dtb > Generate system.dts from system.dtb
   dtc -I dts -O dtb -o system.dtb system.dts > Generate system.dtb from system.dts
7. What are the base set of device nodes required in a DTSpec-compliant device-tree ?
   >A>
   - root node
   - One /cpus node
   - At least one memory node
8. What is unit-address of the Node ? From where to get it ?
   >A>
   - The unit-address component of the node identifies the base address of the bus on which the node sits. It is the primary address used to access the device.
   - You can find it from Peripheral memory map of corresponding device's datasheet / reference manual.
9. What is "compatible" property  ? And what is use of it ?
   >A>
   - Used to bind a device with the driver.
   - The compatible property value consists of one or more strings that define the specific programming model for the device. This list of strings should be used by a client program for device driver selection.
   - The property value consists of a concatenated list of null terminated strings, from most specific to most general.
   - They allow a device to express its compatibility with a family of similar devices, potentially allowing a single device driver to match against several devices.
10. Give me device-tree syntax for defining below use-cases ?
    >A>
    1. A list of strings
       a-string-list-property = "first string", "second string";
    2. A list of byte/binary data
       a-byte-date-property = [0x12, 0x34, 0x56, 0x78];
11. What is the use "phandle" property ?
    >A>
    - A phandle value is a way to reference another node in the device-tree.
    - Any node that can be referenced defines a phandle property with a unique <u32> value. That number is used for the value of properties with a phandle value type.
    - Most device-trees in DTS will not contain explicit phandle properties. The DTC tool automatically inserts the phandle properties when the DTS is compiled into the binary DTB format.
12. What is the use "reg" property ?
   >A>
   Defines address and length of the register area.
   The reg property describes the address of the device’s resources within the address space defined by its parent bus.
   Most commonly this means the offsets and lengths of memory-mapped IO register blocks, but may have a different meaning on some bus types. Addresses in the address space defined by the root node are CPU real addresses.
13. Suppose a device within a system-on-a-chip had two blocks of registers, a 32-byte block at offset 0x3000 in the SOC and a 256-byte block at offset 0xFE00. What would be reg encoded property ?
    >A> reg = <0x3000 0x20 0xFE00 0x100> ;
14. How can we define a node with label in device-tree ?
    >A>
    node_label : node_name@unit_address  // if there is reg space
    node_label : node_name //if no reg space
15. How can I identify root node in device tree ?
    >A> It has no node-name or unit-address, and starts with forward slash (/)
16. Is it okay to have two nodes with same name ?
    >A> It is Okay If both have different unit-addresses or one has unit-address and one have no unit-address.
17. Explain #address-cells and #size-cells properties
    >A>
    - The #address-cells and #size-cells properties may be used in any device node that has children in the device-tree hierarchy and describes how child device nodes should be addressed.
    - The #address-cells property defines the number of <u32> cells used to encode the address field in a child node’s reg property.
    - The #size-cells property defines the number of <u32> cells used to encode the size field in a child node’s reg property.
18. Does #address-cells and #size-cells inherited from ancestors in device-tree ?
    >A> No. They shall be explicitly defined.
19. What is Device tree bindings ? What its location in kernel source ?
    >A>
    It describes the syntax used to describe specific types and classes of devices.
    Location: <kernel-source>/Documentation/devicetree/bindings/
20. Which device-tree property/ies used for address translation/mapping between child and parent bus?
    >A>
    - ranges and dma-ranges
    read: https://elinux.org/Device_Tree_Usage#Ranges_.28Address_Translation.29
21. What is interrupt controller ? Which DT property is used to define a device as interrupt controller in device-tree ?
    >A> An interrupt controller is a physical device and will need a driver to handle interrupts routed through it. It may also cascade into another interrupt domain. An interrupt controller is specified by the presence of an "interrupt-controller" property on that node in the device-tree.
22. What is "#interrupt-cells" property ?
    >A> Indicates the number of cells in the interrupts property for the interrupts managed by the selected interrupt controller.
23. What are "interrupt-parent" and "interrupts" property ?
    >A>
    - The physical wiring of an interrupt source to an interrupt controller is represented in the device-tree with the interrupt-parent property. It is a phandle that points to the interrupt controller for the current node.
    - Nodes that represent interrupt-generating devices contain an interrupt-parent property which has a phandle value that points to the device to which the device’s interrupts are routed, typically an interrupt controller. If an interrupt-generating device does not have an interrupt-parent property, its interrupt parent is assumed to be its device-tree parent.
    - Each interrupt generating device contains an interrupts property with a value describing one or more interrupt sources for that device.
24. What is need of "interrupt-extended" property ?
    >A> The interrupts-extended property lists the interrupt(s) generated by a device. "interrupts-extended" should be used instead of "interrupts" when a device is connected to multiple interrupt controllers as it encodes a parent "phandle" with each interrupt specifier.
25. What is interrupt nexus ?
