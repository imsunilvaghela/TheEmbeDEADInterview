1. Give me one line definition of device-driver (fine with layman's terms)
    >A>
    A device driver is a piece of software which drives device.
    Device drivers are computer programs that control how different hardware devices interact with the operating system. They act as a bridge between the hardware and the software, allowing the two to communicate with each other. Without device drivers, hardware devices would not be able to function properly.
2. Types of device drivers?
    >A> Block(storage vertical) oriented, byte(character vertical)  oriented and packet(network vertical) oriented
3. What is the difference between application written in kernel and user space ?
4. Major number in device driver
    4.1. What Is Major Number And It's Usage ?
         >A>
         It's an  integer number  mainly used to provide the association between the device driver and device file . this number is  used by kernel.
         (or)
         The major number tells you which driver handles which device file.
    4.2. Any example of Major number for different devices.
5. Minor number in device driver
    5.1. What is Minor Number And It's Usage ?
         >A>
         The Minor number is used only by the driver itself to differentiate which device it's operating on, just in case the driver handles more than one device.
         (or)
         One driver can control more than one device. minor will be used to distinguish the one device from other devices
    5.2. Who uses minor number ? Kernel or Driver ?
6. What do you understand with term "kernel module" ?
    >A> Kernel modules are pieces of code that can be loaded and unloaded into the kernel upon demand.
7. Write a simplest Kernel module which prints "Hello World!" on load and "Bye Bye world!" on unload.
    >A>
    #include <linux/module.h> /* Needed by all modules */
    #include <linux/kernel.h> /* Needed for KERN_INFO */

    int init_module (void)
    {
         printk(KERN_INFO "Hello World!\n");
         return 0 ;
    }

    void cleanup_module (void)
    {
         printk(KERN_INFO "Bye Bye World!\n");
    }

    Ask questions from written module code.
8. Can I replace init_module / cleanup_module with any custom functions ? Using module_init and module_exit
9. Write a simple makefile to compile above linux module
    >A>
    obj-m += hello.o

    all :
    make -C /lib/modules/$(shell uname -r)/build M=$(PWD) modules

    clean :
    make -C /lib/modules/$(shell uname -r)/build M=$(PWD) clean
    //and then make
10. Have you came across any limitation of printk with compare to printf ? Give me example.
11. Have you used dmesg ? How can I monitor dmesg in real-time ? watch "dmesg | tail –n 20"  or  dmesg -w
12. Which command is used to get information about any kernel module ? Modinfo. What informations does it shows ?
13. Insmod, rmmod, lsmod and modprobe
    13.1. Difference between modprobe and insmod. What is command to unload any given module using modprobe ?
    13.2. modprobe loads all dependent modules first and then load the given module - How modprobe does it ?
    13.3. What are steps to follow in order to load module using modprobe ?
        >A>
            1. sudo ln -s /path/to/your-kernel-module.ko /lib/modules/`uname -r`/   OR sudo cp /path/to/your-kernel-module.ko /lib/modules/`uname -r`/
            2. sudo depmod -a ( Generate a list of kernel module dependencies and associated map files. )
            3. sudo modprobe your-kernel-module
    13.4. What is use depmod command ?
    13.5. How can I find out currently loaded kernel modules ? using lsmod and cat /proc/modules
    13.6. I am rmmod'ing a kernel module, but failed with device busy error. How can I check number of processes are using kernel module ? lsmod | grep module_name -> number of processes using a kernel module (in 3rd row)
14. __init* and __exit* macros
    14.1. In dmesg, I observed "Freeing unused kernel memory : 128k freed" message. Can you tell me how does kernel freeing such memory ?
        >A>
        Some functions in the kernel source code are marked with __init because they run only once during initialization. This instructs    the compiler to mark a function in a special way. The linker collects all such functions and puts them at the end of the final     binary file.
        When the kernel starts, this code runs only once during initialization. After it runs, the kernel can free this memory to reuse it and you will see the kernel message: e.g. "Freeing unused kernel memory: 128k freed"
    14.2. __init, __exit, __initdata , __exitdata,  __exitcall etc
    14.3. Where these macros are defined in? <kernel-source>/include/linux/init.h
15. What is need for MODULE_LICENSE ? Is it compulsory required ?
16. Kernel module arguments
    16.1. How can you pass arguments to the kernel module ? Using module_param* macros.
    16.2. How can you add description of the variable ? Which file we need to include to access these macros? <linux/moduleparam.h>
        >A>
         static int port_state = 0 ;
         module_param(port_state, bool , 0644 );  /* A Boolean type */
         MODULE_PARM_DESC(port_state, "default state of the port" );

         /* call with */
         ./insmod mymodule.ko port_state=2
    16.3. I need to pass an integer array as an argument to kernel module – How can I  ?
    16.4. I need to pass a string as an argument to kernel module – How can I  ?
17. How can you identify if the device is block device or character device ? Use ls –l , if first byte is C – Char device, if B – Block device
18. What is file_operations structure ?
19. dev_t type
    19.1. What is dev_t ?
    >A> dev_t is the data type introduced in kernel 2.6. It’s nothing but a 32 bit integer,
        in which the first 12 bits holds the major number and the remaining 20 bits holds the minor number.
    19.2. What is mkdev macro ?
    >A> Given two integers - major and minor numbers, MKDEV combines them into one 32 bit dev_t compatible number.
    19.3. What are macros to find major number and minor number from dev_t ?
    >A>
        MAJOR(dev_t dev);
              The macro MAJOR accepts a dev_t type number which is 32 bits, and returns a major number
        MINOR(dev_t dev);
              The macro MINOR accepts a dev_t type number which is 32 bits, and returns a minor number
    19.4. I have a dev = 0x0F800001. What will major number and minor number of the device ?
    >A>
        dev = 0x0F800001 (For Major number = 248 and Minor number = 1 )
        MAJOR (dev) = 0x0F800001 >> 20 = 0x0F8 = 248
        MINOR (dev) = 0x0F800001 & 0x000FFFFF = 0x1 = 1

        strncpy_from_user
23. After creating character devices, How can you access it from user-space ? OR
    How /dev/* entries being created ?
    >A>
        1. Use mknod to manually add a device node (older method)
            mknod /dev/<name> c <major> <minor>  OR

        2. Use udev
            This is where the class_create and device_create come in.
            To notify udev from your kernel module, you first create a virtual device class using class_create()
            Now, the name will appear in /sys/class/<name>.
            Then, create a device and register it with sysfs using device_create()
            Now, device name will appear in /sys/devices/virtual/<class name>/<device name> and /dev/<device name>

24. Ways to communicate between userspace and kernel space:
    IOCTL, Procfs, Sysfs, Configfs, Debugfs, Sysctl, UDP Sockets, Netlink Sockets
25. IOCTL
    25.1. How can you define an IOCTL ? Give me example.
    >A>
        #define "ioctl name" __IOX("magic number","command number","argument type")

        where IOX can be,
        IO: an IOCTL with no parameters
        IOW: an IOCTL with write parameters ( copy_from_user )
        IOR: an IOCTL with read parameters ( copy_to_user )
        IOWR: an IOCTL with both write and read parameters

        The Magic Number is a unique number or character that will differentiate our set of ioctl calls from the other ioctl calls. sometimes the major number for the device is used here.

        Command Number is the number that is assigned to the ioctl . This is used to differentiate the commands from one another.

        The argument type is the type of data.

    25.2. What is magic number in IOCTL ?
26. /proc file system (procfs)
    26.1. What is proc file system ? For what purposes it is used ?
    26.2. I want to create a procfs entry in /proc/<module_name>/info in kernel module. How can I create?
    >A>
        proc_mkdir()  // To create directory with module_name in /proc/ directory
        proc_entry()  // To create /proc/<module_name>/info
    26.3. Write a sample kernel module, which can print an incremental number from /proc/<module_name>/info starting from 1 – everytime you read using cat /proc/<module_name>/info.
    26.4. How to remove a procfs entry created in kernel module?  using remove_proc_entry()
27. /sys file system (sysfs)
    27.1. What is sysfs ? How it differs from procfs ?
    27.2. What is struct kobject ?  and struct kobj_attribute ?
    27.3. I want to create below sysfs file in kernel module to read/write to/from user.
          Consider info would be an integer value. How can I ?
            I. /sys/kernel/info
            >A>
                volatile int user_info = 0 ;
                static ssize_t sysfs_show ( struct kobject * kobj, struct kobj_attribute * attr, char * buf)
                {
                    return sprintf(buf, "%d \n " , user_info);
                }

                static ssize_t sysfs_store ( struct kobject * kobj, struct kobj_attribute * attr, const char * buf, size_t count)
                {
                    sscanf(buf, "%d" , &user_info);
                    return count;
                }
                struct kobj_attribute kattr_ptr = __ATTR(user_info, 0660 , sysfs_show, sysfs_store);
                struct kobject *kobj_ref = kobject_create_and_add( "info" ,kernel_kobj);
                sysfs_create_file(kobj_ref, &kattr_ptr.attr);
            II. /sys/firmware/info
            >A>
                Use firmware_kobj instead of kernel_kobj in above code snippet
                struct kobject *kobj_ref; kobj_ref = kobject_create_and_add( "info" ,firmware_kobj);
            III. /sys/fs/info
            >A>
                Use fs_kobj instead of kernel_kobj in above code snippet
                struct kobject *kobj_ref; kobj_ref = kobject_create_and_add( "info" ,fs_kobj);
            IV. /sys/info
            >A>
                Use NULL instead of kernel_kobj in above code snippet
