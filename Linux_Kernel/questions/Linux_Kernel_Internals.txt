1. How logs are printed in linux kernel and what are the logs level available in linux.
   >A>
   printk used to print kernel logs. One can also use pr_ APIs. e.g. pr_debug, pr_warning, pr_err etc
   e.g. printk(KERN_DEBUG "Hello World\n");
   Kernel Log levels:
   KERN_EMERG   0 - Emergency: The system is unusable
   KERN_ALERT   1 - Alert: Actions that must be taken care of immediately
   KERN_CRIT    2 - Critical: Critical conditions
   KERN_ERR     3 - Error: Non-critical error conditions
   KERN_WARNING 4 - Warning: Warning conditions that should be taken care of.
   KERN_NOTICE  5 - Notice: Normal, but significant events.
   KERN_INFO    6 - Info: Informational messages that require no action.
   KERN_DEBUG   7 - Debug: Kernel debugging messages, output by the kernel if the developer enabled debugging at compile time

   Trick to remember above sequence:

346. What do you understand by all APIs in linux kernel which are starting with atomic_* ?
>A>
    - In the context of Linux kernel APIs, the term "atomic" refers to an operation or function that
      is guaranteed to execute without interruption, providing mutual exclusion or indivisibility of
      certain operations. Atomic operations are designed to ensure consistency and prevent race
      conditions in concurrent or multi-threaded programming environments.

    - Atomic operations typically provide the following guarantees:
      1. Indivisibility: An atomic operation appears to occur instantaneously and cannot be interrupted
         by other concurrent operations. It either completes entirely or not at all.
      2. Mutual Exclusion: Atomic operations provide mutual exclusion, ensuring that only one thread or
         process can perform the operation at a time. This prevents race conditions and ensures data consistency.
      3. Ordering Constraints: Atomic operations can also impose ordering constraints on memory accesses.
         They ensure that memory operations performed before or after the atomic operation are correctly
	 ordered with respect to other threads or processes.
347. Can you explain wait_event_interruptible_timeout() API of Linux Kernel ?
>A>
    - The wait_event_interruptible_timeout function is a blocking wait function provided by the
      Linux kernel. It is commonly used in device drivers and other kernel code to wait for a
      certain condition to be satisfied, with a specified timeout period.
    - The purpose of wait_event_interruptible_timeout is to put the calling process or thread to
      sleep until the specified condition becomes true or until a specified timeout period elapses.
      It allows the process or thread to wait in a sleep state, conserving CPU resources, until the
      condition is met or the timeout occurs.
    - The function takes two parameters: a wait queue condition to wait for and a timeout value. The
      wait queue condition is typically a predicate that evaluates to true when the desired
      condition is satisfied. The timeout value specifies the maximum time in which the
      process/thread is willing to wait for the condition to be met.
    - During the waiting period, the process/thread can be woken up by a signal, allowing it to be
      interrupted and resume execution. This is indicated by the return value of wait_event_interruptible_timeout,
      which can indicate whether the condition was satisfied or a timeout occurred.
    - It is useful in scenarios where a driver or kernel code needs to wait for a certain event or
      condition to occur before proceeding. It provides a way to efficiently wait for a condition
      while still allowing the process/thread to be responsive to signals and timeouts
