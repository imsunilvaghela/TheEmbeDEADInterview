Questions/Topics:
-----------------

1. Memory layout of C program

  4.3. What is the size of character variable ? and integer variable ?
5. Types of operators and examples of each – can ask about operator precedence
  5.1. Post-increment vs pre-increment.. Ask for example
6. Useful C library functions - strlen, strcpy, strstr, strncpy, atoi, itoa, sprintf, sscanf etc etc...

  6.3. Which library function you will use to parse this data in "Name : marks" format ? Where Name is in string form, and marks is in integer ...e.g "Sunil : 50"
7. C Variables
  7.1. What is lifetime and scope of variable ?
  7.2. Scope of a variables in c – Global, Local and function scope
  7.3. Variable declaration and variable definition. Which one of below is/are declaration ? Explain.
        int a;
        int a = 10;
        extern int a;
     >A> ONLY c is declaration, as declaring variable as extern does not allocate any memory for that variable.. Other two cases are declaration + definition.

9. Difference between little endian and big-endian system.
  9.1. Representation of 0x11223344 in big-endian and little endian
      >A>
	    Big-endian:
        0x1000  0x1001  0x1002  0x1003
        0x11       0x22      0x33       0x44
        Little-endian:
        0x1000  0x1001  0x1002  0x1003
        0x44       0x33      0x22       0x11
  9.2. What are bi-endians?
      >A> Bi-endian processors can run in both modes little and big endian.
  9.3. Does endianness affects file formats?
      >A> File formats which have 1 byte as a basic unit are independent of endianness e.g., ASCII files. Other file formats use some fixed endianness format e.g, JPEG files are stored in big endian format.

  12.2. Difference between macro and typedef
13.  Array/2d array.. Ask for declaration and definition..
14.  Function calling methods in C – call by reference, call by value
15.  Type casting in C
16.  Recursion in C.. When you can use it ? Advantage and disadvantage.. What to take care while using?
17.  Pointers

18.  Storage classes in c and example
  18.1. What are different storage classes in C ? What is the difference between extern and static ?
  18.2. Where does auto variables get stored ?
  18.3. What if a static variable used in the function or in file, or as a global variable ? what will its
  18.4. scope be in all three use cases ?
  18.5. What is the use of extern storage class ? How to use a variable declared in another file in a
  18.6. current file using extern ?
  18.7. What is register storage class ? When to use it?
